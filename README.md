## Features

### Supported File Types

- **Plain Text (.txt)** - General text analysis with word frequency and readability metrics
- **Markdown (.md)** - Document structure analysis including headers, links, images, and code blocks
- **Log Files (.log)** - Log level analysis, error detection, and timestamp extraction
- **Rust Source Code (.rs)** - Code structure analysis including functions, structs, enums, and imports
- **Unknown Extensions** - Falls back to plain text analysis

### Building from Source

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd text-summarizer
```

2. Build the project:

cargo test
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
cargo run <file_path>
```

Or if using the compiled binary:

```bash
./target/release/text-summarizer <file_path>
```

### Examples

   • Enums: FileType
```

#### Analyzing a Markdown File
```bash
cargo run README.md
```

Output:
```
File Summary: README.md

```

### Error Handling

The tool provides clear error messages for common issues:

- **File not found**: `Error: File 'nonexistent.txt' does not exist.`
- **Permission denied**: `Error reading file 'protected.txt': Permission denied`
- **Invalid usage**: Shows usage help with supported file types

## Code Architecture

### Core Components

#### `FileType` Enum
Defines supported file types and provides extension-based detection:
```rust
enum FileType {
    Text, Markdown, Log, RustCode, Unknown
}
```

#### `FileSummary` Struct
Contains analysis results including:
- File type classification
- Basic statistics (lines, words, characters)
- Key insights as readable strings
- Detailed statistics as key-value pairs

#### `TextAnalyzer` Struct
Main analysis engine with specialized methods:
- `analyze_text()` - General text analysis
- `analyze_markdown()` - Markdown-specific parsing
- `analyze_log()` - Log file analysis with error detection
- `analyze_rust_code()` - Rust source code structure analysis

### Key Algorithms

**Word Frequency Analysis:**
- Filters out words shorter than 3 characters
- Converts to lowercase and removes punctuation
- Sorts by frequency for top word identification

**Markdown Parsing:**
- Header detection using `#` prefix counting
- Link detection via `](` pattern matching
- Image detection via `![` pattern matching
- Code block counting with ```` delimiters

**Log Analysis:**
- Pattern matching for common log levels
- Error keyword detection (ERROR, EXCEPTION, FAIL)
- Timestamp extraction from line beginnings
- Time range calculation

**Rust Code Analysis:**
- Function signature parsing with parameter detection
- Struct/enum declaration identification  
- Import statement categorization
- Comment ratio calculation
- TODO/FIXME marker detection

## Testing

The project includes unit tests covering:

- Basic text analysis functionality
- File type detection accuracy
- Markdown parsing capabilities
- Word counting algorithms

Run tests with detailed output:
```bash
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

## Performance

The tool is optimized for:
- **Memory efficiency**: Processes files line-by-line where possible
- **Speed**: Uses efficient string operations and HashMap-based counting
- **Scalability**: Handles large files by avoiding full content duplication

Typical performance on modern hardware:
- Small files (<1MB): Near-instantaneous
- Medium files (1-10MB): <1 second  
- Large files (10-100MB): <5 seconds

## Limitations
- **Binary files**: Only processes text-based files
- **Character encoding**: Assumes UTF-8 encoding
- **Memory usage**: Loads entire file content into memory
- **Language detection**: Limited to extension-based file type detection
