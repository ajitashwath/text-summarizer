Rust is a modern systems programming language designed to provide high performance without sacrificing safety. 
It emphasizes memory safety through its unique ownership and borrowing model, 
eliminating entire classes of bugs such as null pointer dereferencing and data races. 
Rust offers low-level control similar to C and C++, but with stronger guarantees about correctness and concurrency. 
Its expressive type system, pattern matching, and powerful abstractions make it suitable for both system-level development and application code.
Developers often choose Rust for building reliable, efficient software such as 
operating systems, web servers, game engines, and command-line tools.
